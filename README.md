Comparison of Computer Security Evaluation Criteria

This paper was written in 1997 as part of a minor software engineering thesis
in my final year of my undegraduate software engineering degree.

The paper is basically a comparison of computer security standards. 
Three different computer security standards are compared (US, European and
Canadian). 

The paper has been recompiled using pdflatex and the fancyheadings package has
been replaced with fancyhdr. Otherwise it has been unchanged from the one
submitted in October 1997. The corresponding presentation is the same except
for a change in presentation packages from seminar to beamer.
